Final Reflection

This semester has been a wild ride, and I’ve picked up a lot about data science along the way. From tackling messy datasets to figuring out how to make data tell a story, I’ve learned skills that connect to my personal life, future plans, and even my dream of being a Musical Theatre Actor.

### **Exploring Data Science Topics and Methods**

At first, we started with the basics, like cleaning up data and organizing it properly. It might sound simple, but these lessons really hammered home why accuracy matters. Stuff like handling missing values and standardizing data made me feel way more prepared to deal with real-world messiness. 

One of the projects that really stuck with me involved working on a massive dataset. It wasn’t just about technical know-how—I had to figure out the best way to approach the problem. Balancing efficiency with depth taught me how to focus on what’s important and pick the right tools for the job.

### **Personal Growth and Application**

Beyond class, these skills have totally changed how I see the world of technology. Now, whenever I see data in the news or on social media, I think twice. I’ve learned to spot stuff like sampling bias or misleading numbers, and it’s made me way more critical about the info I take in.

What’s even cooler is how data science connects to my personal life. My siblings and I loved playing "JUST DANCE," and it’s all about rhythm and strategy—a mix of creativity and precision, just like data science. Whether it’s nailing the right moves or refining datasets, both take practice and focus. It’s made me realize how much problem-solving and having fun go hand in hand.

### **Future Studies and Professional Ambitions**

Looking ahead, I’m pumped about how I can use these skills in my future. My aspiration is to be a Musical Theatre Actor, and while it might not seem related to data science, there’s actually a lot of overlap. Both are about storytelling. Data science has taught me how to weave a narrative with numbers, and that’s something I can bring to the stage. For example, understanding audience trends or figuring out what makes a show successful could really help shape my career.

What’s also great about data science is how versatile it is. Whether it’s working with numbers, tech, or creative fields, these skills apply everywhere. This semester showed me that data science isn’t just about crunching numbers—it’s about asking smart questions, telling stories, and making a difference.

### **Conclusion**

Looking back, I’m proud of how much I’ve grown. Data science has given me tools to solve problems and make smarter decisions, both in everyday life and in chasing my dream of performing. I’m excited to keep building on what I’ve learned and see how far it can take me.
