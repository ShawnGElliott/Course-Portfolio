This assignment was a great way to practice using Python and figuring out how to work with lists, loops, and the Counter Module. It was kind of cool to see how all the pieces fit together, but it also had its fair share of struggles.

At first, I kept running into silly errors. For example, I forgot to put quotes around the strings in the list of professions, and Python just didn’t like that. It’s crazy how one small mistake can break everything. It definitely reminded me to double-check the basics.

Another tricky part was writing the if and elif statements for the gender list. I had to really think about how to cover all the possible cases, especially for the “not known” gender. It took a few tries to get the logic right, but it felt good once it finally worked.

The part with the Counter module was new for me, and it was kind of confusing at first. I didn’t know how to find the least common profession since I was only familiar with finding the most common one. After playing around with it and looking stuff up, I figured out how to get the last item from the sorted list. That was definitely a win.

I learned a lot about how Python makes working with data easier. Filtering lists and counting items seemed really complicated at first, but Python has so many built-in tools that make it pretty simple once you know what to do.

I also realized how important it is to plan things out before diving in. For example, creating an empty list to store results in the Spinster\_task made the whole thing way easier to code. It’s like taking a second to think saves a lot of time later.

Probably the biggest thing I learned, though, is that making mistakes is part of the process. Every time I ran into an error, it pushed me to understand what went wrong and fix it. By the end, I actually felt more confident in my coding.

This assignment wasn’t easy, but it was worth it. I got to practice a bunch of different Python skills and solve problems in a hands-on way. Even though it was frustrating at times, it was also super satisfying to see everything come together and work the way it was supposed to… I hope.
